# English-tutors-flask-app v2 with SQL database

It's my second app on the Flask learning course. I make site of english language tutors.

Using dependencies: Flask + WTForms, Bootstrap 4. As a database I will use JSON file. But also there'll be a version with SQLAlchemy and SQLite db on the other branch.

The site has:
* '/' - main page;
* '/all/' - page of all tutors;
* '/profiles/<tutor_id>/' - page of a certain tutor;
* '/goals/\<goal>/' - page with relevant tutors by certain goal;
* '/booking/<tutor_id>/<class_day>/\<time>/' - booking page and booking done page;
* '/request/' - page of request for mathing a relevant tutor and request done page;


< ðŸ”» *in progress* ðŸ”» >
* '/admin/' - admin's page with logging in for creating/editing/deleting tutors, goals and etc.;
